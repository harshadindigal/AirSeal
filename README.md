### Key Points:
- Code blocks are properly enclosed in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
- Lists and headers use markdown syntax (e.g., `-` for bullet points and `###` for headings).
- No extra spacing is used where it could break formatting on GitHub, but sections are clearly divided.

This should display well-formatted content on your GitHub page.
